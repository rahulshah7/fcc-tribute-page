            are the base of, and extend to form his work principles.
            </p>

            <p>
            Dalio believes having principles are essential for getting what you want out of life.
            He defines principles as what connect your values i.e. what you value in life, to your actions.
            They can be applied again and again in similar situations to help you achieve your goals.
            Our most valuable principles come from our own experiences and our reflections on those experiences.
            </p>

            <p>
            Dalio's own principles are described in detail in his original 2011 self published book, available at
